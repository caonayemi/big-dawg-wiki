#thinking....

# so the "edit" version of create-new-version doesn't seem to be working

# publishing is still an issue (can't be seen); so it is unclear if the "new" version of create-new-version is working

# as part of both of the above, a user needs the ability to select categories(tags) w/ which they will associate the article

# the above edit functionality needs to be scoped to a user's own articles + admin access

# when editing an article, a user should be able to see previous versions of the article

# editing an unpublished version is still an issue, again due to not being able to access unpublished work

# it is outside of the scope of my mandate....   but I really dislike that creating an "article" and creating a "version" happens on two seperate forms.  In my mind, these things should be synonums to the user and all distinctions completely obscured.


# Tasks

		# - should repopulate if an unedited version is pulled up
		# - should have buttons to delete and publish
		# - needs to take variables @current_version, @unpublished_version, @categories, ~@article
